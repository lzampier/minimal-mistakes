# About

I am a postdoc at Princeton University and member of the [M2LInES project](https://m2lines.github.io/). I am using machine learning methods to improve and accelerate ocean mesoscale eddy parameterizations.

# Before joining the M2LInES team, I worked with the [Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy Climate Process Team (CPT)](https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io/). My research with the CPT was focused on better understanding the ocean eddy energy cycle and improving mesoscale eddy parameterizations by making them energetically consistent.
# I have also worked on adjoint modeling and ocean state estimation within the [ECCO project](https://ecco-group.org/). Within the ECCO framework, I applied techniques from the computational sciences in order to quantify uncertainties in ocean state estimates and gain new insights into how to improve the global ocean observing system. 

# I am engaged in developing [open-source Python tools](https://gcm-filters.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to enable our community to perform efficient, reproducible, and open science. 
# I am a PI in the [DJ4Earth project](https://dj4earth.github.io/), where we develop and use an open-source framework for universal differentiable programming in [Julia](https://julialang.org/), which integrates Bayesian inverse methods with scientific machine learning in Earth system models.

# When I'm not doing research, I like being active in the outdoors. I love rock climbing, trail running, and backcountry skiing.
